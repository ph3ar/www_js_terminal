## 2024-03-26 - [Unsanitized inputs to pty.spawn]
**Vulnerability:** Command/Argument Injection via unsanitized `data.host` and `data.port` parameters in `socket.on('start')` which were directly passed to `pty.spawn`. An attacker could inject arguments starting with `-` like `-oProxyCommand`.
**Learning:** Even though `pty.spawn` doesn't execute a shell directly, passing completely arbitrary arguments starting with hyphens can invoke dangerous features of the underlying program (e.g. telnet).
**Prevention:** Always sanitize and validate socket inputs using strict regex (e.g., ensuring hostnames start with alphanumeric characters `^[a-zA-Z0-9]`) and explicitly parsing/bounding numbers before passing them to OS-level spawn commands.
